<p align="justify">  One of the biggest things that people of online communities tend to overlook is the fact that words do hurt. Although these things that are hurtful are not being said online, saying them online can amount to just as much hurt and maybe even more. I have been a witness and a victim to cyberbullying and have seen the effects that it can have on the victims and overall online communities that play a part with it.  In this post I will talk about why cyberbullying should be stopped, it’s effects on social sites, methods that could be taken in order to prevent it.
